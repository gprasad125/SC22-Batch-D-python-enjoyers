Let's go with an [SVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YPScrckx28). We will do the first step for you.\n\nI know it was a lot of information in the last section, but the code is *basically* the same. Since our data is already split, you will follow the same steps to fit your model, make some predictions, evaluate the performance, and visualize your confusion matrix.\n\n","metadata":{"id":"ObvQ_3pPmPBf"},"pos":53,"type":"cell"}

Discuss with your team about why we should do this. \n\nOne we we can compare them is visual inspection. With that said, would you recommend going through by hand and making a tally for every time the one's and zero's don't match up?\n\nPlease don't do this. Please save yourself this nasty headache when we can just do math. Below is a common way to do this, called mean squared error. \n\nTo get mean squared error, we compute the difference between each element in `y_hat` and `y_test` and square it and then get the average of all of that to see how far off we are.","metadata":{"id":"SbywAxezkRN8"},"pos":47,"type":"cell"}
